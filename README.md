# Overview

Spam Detector is a machine learning-based project designed to classify messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant text features and build a classification model to detect spam messages accurately.

# Features

ğŸ’ Preprocessing of text data

ğŸ’ Feature extraction (character count, word count, sentence count)

ğŸ’ Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

ğŸ’ Heatmap of feature correlations using Seaborn

ğŸ’ Machine learning model for spam classification

# Dataset

The project uses a spam message dataset containing labeled messages as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate messages). The dataset is preprocessed and transformed into numerical features for model training.

# Technologies Used

ğŸ’ Python

ğŸ’ Pandas

ğŸ’ NumPy

ğŸ’ Seaborn

ğŸ’ Matplotlib

ğŸ’ Scikit-learn
